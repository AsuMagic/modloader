## Configuration for AsuMagic's ModLoader

#### CAUTION ###################################################################################################################
## This is the ***template*** file. Do NOT modify any files from the 'Mods/ModLoader' folder - it will NOT work!              ##
## You have to copy this file in the 'Cache/' folder and edit it from there. You'll be safe ignoring this warning afterwards. ##

## Server hosts:
# If a mod you want to install depends on ModLoader, you simply have to copy-paste the lines of code it asks you to add within this file.
# If no such instruction was given, and if 'ModLoader' isn't ever mentioned, you aren't looking for this file - instead change the regular mods.cfg file in the KAG folder.

## As a modder, this is the file you need to inform the changes of to install your mod.
# ModLoader is capable of automatically calling AddScript for given files for your mods, through a DefaultStart.as patch.
# To add a script, simply add the name of your script, with the .as extension.
# The scripts will be added as CRules scripts just after loading the first map (and before connecting, when runlocalhost is used); so your CRules@ hooks will be called accordingly.

scripts = modloader_working.as;
